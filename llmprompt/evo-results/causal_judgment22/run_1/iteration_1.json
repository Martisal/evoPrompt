As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to \"guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns.\" Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped.
