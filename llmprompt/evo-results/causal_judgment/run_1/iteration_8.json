The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to sell the battery to him, and his friend says that he's willing to sell it for a fair price, so Billy buys the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two Bartlett batteries. Since all the car needed was at least one Bartlett battery, they were able to start the car.

After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition.

The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away.
