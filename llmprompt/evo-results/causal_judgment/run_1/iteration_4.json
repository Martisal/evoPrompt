For instance:\nQUESTION: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, \"We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment.\" The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to \"guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns.\" Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?\nANSWER: no\n[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}, "mapping_values": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, {"genotype": [[1], [0], [1], [], [], [1, 1, 1, 0], [0], [], [0], [4, 5, 2, 3], [49], [], [], [], []], "fitness": 0.5833333333333334, "mapping_values": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "tree_depth": 7, "phenotype": "How would a typical person answer this question about causation?

The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\nANSWER: no\nQUESTION: Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company.
