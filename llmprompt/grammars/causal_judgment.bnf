<example> ::= QUESTION: Billy and Suzy inherited an unusual type of hybrid car that has two special car batteries called Bartlett batteries. The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to sell the battery to him, and his friend says that he's willing to sell it for a fair price, so Billy buys the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two Bartlett batteries. Since all the car needed was at least one Bartlett battery, they were able to start the car. Did Billy cause the car to be able to start?\nANSWER: yes|QUESTION: Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?\nANSWER: no|QUESTION: Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing dangerous viruses are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing dangerous viruses are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing dangerous viruses?\nANSWER: yes|QUESTION: The CEO of a company is sitting in his office when his Vice President of R&D comes in and says, 'We are thinking of starting a new programme. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.' The CEO responds that he doesn't care about harming the environment and just wants to make as much profit as possible. The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed. Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment?\nANSWER: yes|QUESTION: A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\nANSWER: no|QUESTION: Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, some work emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Zoe cause some work emails containing important customer information to be deleted from the central computer?\nANSWER: yes|QUESTION: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment." The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to "guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns." Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?\nANSWER: no|QUESTION: Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?\nANSWER: no|QUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?\nANSWER: no|QUESTION: Joe was feeling quite dehydrated, so he stopped by the local smoothie shop to buy the largest sized drink available. Before ordering, the cashier told him that if he bought a Mega-Sized Smoothie he would get it in a special commemorative cup. Joe replied, 'I don't care about a commemorative cup, I just want the biggest smoothie you have.' Sure enough, Joe received the Mega-Sized Smoothie in a commemorative cup. Did Joe intentionally obtain the commemorative cup?\nANSWER: no
