For instance:\\nQUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?\\nANSWER: no\\nQUESTION: A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\\nANSWER: no\\nQUESTION: Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?\\nANSWER: no", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[2], [2, 2, 1], [], [1], [], [], [0], [0, 0], [0], [], [26]], "fitness": 0.18, "mapping_values": [1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1], "tree_depth": 6, "phenotype": "Taking it one step at a time, let's think through the details.\\nYou are a human that needs to solve a task.\\nYou are a human that needs to solve a task.\\n[[INPUT]]\\nHow would a typical person answer this question about causation?
