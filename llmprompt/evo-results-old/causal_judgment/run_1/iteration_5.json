They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, some work emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Zoe cause some work emails containing important customer information to be deleted from the central computer?\\nANSWER: yes\\nQUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?\\nANSWER: no\\nTaking a methodical approach, let's analyze this.\\nHow would a typical person answer this question about causation?
