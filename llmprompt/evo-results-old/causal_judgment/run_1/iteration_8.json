The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\\nANSWER: no", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[0], [0], [], [1], [], [], [0], [], [0], [], [26]], "fitness": 0.18, "mapping_values": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "tree_depth": 3, "phenotype": "How would a typical person answer this question about causation?
