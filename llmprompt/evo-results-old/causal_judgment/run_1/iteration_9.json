The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to sell the battery to him, and his friend says that he's willing to sell it for a fair price, so Billy buys the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two Bartlett batteries. Since all the car needed was at least one Bartlett battery, they were able to start the car. Did Billy cause the car to be able to start?\\nANSWER: yes\\n[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[3], [1], [], [0], [0], [0], [0], [], [0], [2], [26]], "fitness": 0.5, "mapping_values": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "tree_depth": 4, "phenotype": "How would a typical person answer this question about causation?

They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing dangerous viruses are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing dangerous viruses are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing dangerous viruses?\\nANSWER: yes\\nTaking it one step at a time, let's think through the details.[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[1], [0], [0], [1], [], [0], [0], [], [0], [4], [26]], "fitness": 0.4, "mapping_values": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], "tree_depth": 4, "phenotype": "How would a typical person answer this question about causation?

The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?\\nANSWER: no\\n[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[0], [0], [], [1], [], [], [0], [], [0], [], [26]], "fitness": 0.18, "mapping_values": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "tree_depth": 3, "phenotype": "How would a typical person answer this question about causation?
