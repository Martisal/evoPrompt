For instance:\\nQUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?\\nANSWER: no", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[2], [2, 2, 1], [], [1], [], [], [0], [0, 0], [0], [], [26]], "fitness": 0.22, "mapping_values": [1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1], "tree_depth": 6, "phenotype": "Taking it one step at a time, let's think through the details.\\nYou are a human that needs to solve a task.\\nYou are a human that needs to solve a task.\\n[[INPUT]]\\nHow would a typical person answer this question about causation?
