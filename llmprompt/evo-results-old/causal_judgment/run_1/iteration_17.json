After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?\\nANSWER: no", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[2], [2, 1, 1], [], [1], [], [], [0], [0, 0], [0], [], [26]], "fitness": 0.22, "mapping_values": [1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], "tree_depth": 5, "phenotype": "Taking it one step at a time, let's think through the details.\\nYou are a human that needs to solve a task.\\n[[INPUT]]\\nHow would a typical person answer this question about causation?
