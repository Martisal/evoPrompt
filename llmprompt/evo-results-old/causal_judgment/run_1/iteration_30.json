Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing dangerous viruses?\\nANSWER: yes\\nQUESTION: Billy and Suzy inherited an unusual type of hybrid car that has two special car batteries called Bartlett batteries. The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to sell the battery to him, and his friend says that he's willing to sell it for a fair price, so Billy buys the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two Bartlett batteries.

It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment.\" The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to \"guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns.\" Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped.
