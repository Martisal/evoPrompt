They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing dangerous viruses are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing dangerous viruses are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing dangerous viruses?\\nANSWER: yes\\n[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}, "mapping_values": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}, {"genotype": [[3], [], [], [2], [1], [0], [0], [], [0], [8], [50]], "fitness": 0.4444444444444444, "tree_depth": 4, "phenotype": "Consider these examples:\\nQUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time.

It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment.\" The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to \"guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns.\" Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?\\nANSWER: no\\nHow would a typical person answer this question about causation?
