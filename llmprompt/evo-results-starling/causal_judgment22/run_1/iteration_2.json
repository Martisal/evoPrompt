They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, some work emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Zoe cause some work emails containing important customer information to be deleted from the central computer?\\nANSWER: yes\\nQUESTION: Billy and Suzy inherited an unusual type of hybrid car that has two special car batteries called Bartlett batteries. The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery.

The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine.

A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A.

So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away.
