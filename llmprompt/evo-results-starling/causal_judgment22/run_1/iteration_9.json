The car won't start unless it has at least one Bartlett battery. Having a second Bartlett battery isn't necessary to start the car. When they got the car, both Bartlett batteries were missing. One day, Billy and Suzy are both out of the house. Billy is visiting his friend's house, and notices that his friend has a Bartlett battery. Billy asks his friend to sell the battery to him, and his friend says that he's willing to sell it for a fair price, so Billy buys the Bartlett battery from his friend. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Suzy walks into an automotive parts shop and happens to notice that they have a single Bartlett battery in stock. Suzy decides to buy the Bartlett battery from the shop. When Billy and Suzy get home, they installed the two Bartlett batteries. Since all the car needed was at least one Bartlett battery, they were able to start the car. Did Billy cause the car to be able to start?\\nANSWER: yes\\nQUESTION: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?\\nANSWER: no\\nQUESTION: Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, some work emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Alice also logs in at 9 am.
