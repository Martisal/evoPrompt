For instance:\\nQUESTION: Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, \"We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment.\" The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. The decision was announced by the Chairman of the board, Donald Franklin, whose primary role is to \"guide and mediate board actions with respect to organizational priorities and governance concerns.\" Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?\\nANSWER: no\\nConsidering the details, nuances, intricacies, subtleties, and external influences, let's think about this step by step.[[INPUT]]", "other_info": {}}, {"genotype": [[0], [2, 0], [], [], [], [], [0], [25], [93], [], [20]], "fitness": 0.62, "mapping_values": [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "tree_depth": 4, "phenotype": "You are a technology expert on a podcast, answering questions from listeners about the latest gadgets.\\nHow would an average individual likely answer a question concerning causation?

The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away.
