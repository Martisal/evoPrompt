It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment.\" The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented.
